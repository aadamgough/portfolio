        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>As I explore several different interests that may lead my down new paths, I yearn to combine
            my love for creativity with my technical-orietned skill set. Through my work, I hope you are able to 
            see the beginnings and development of some of my creations.

        <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
        <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
        <p>Our goal for this project was to observe users interact with some sort interface, interview 
            their experience with it, record their observations, and illustrate a storyboard for one a 
            personas we studied. We sought to identify flaws in such interfaces</p>
        <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
        <p>I found that it was often the case that students were able to successful navigate the interface.
            However, there were definately a handful of people who found it frustrating to get help when the
            interface wasn't working the way they wanted it to.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
        <p>Overall, the project demonstrated that tht interface was effective at it's job. I was able to understand
            the "why" behind designing interfaces, as I studied the intricate components of such interface that is
            used on a daily basis. It gave me a more holistic point of view on interactive design in technology.

        <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
        <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
        <p>Our goal for this project was to find a website that could use some updates on the design and 
            accessibility. I was able to identify a local company that I worked for and redesign their 
            website in a non-iteractive manner.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Design Iterations</u></h5>
        <p>My design decisions focused on the simplicity of the website. The original website was a bit
            confusing to use and it was unclear as to how to go about navigating it. Thus, my design
            focused on making sure that the website accessibility was nice and neat.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
        <p>I found that this project had an very large audience, in that people using this website consisted
            of many different ages. Ultimately, I was able to get positive feedback, in that my design was
            clear and simple. However, the details of the website can use some work.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
        <p>This project allowed me to actively redesign the shell of a website while utilizing design considerations
            that we studied in class. It gave me a greater appreciation and understanding of what exactly goes
            into web design and development.

        <h1>Figma Startup Design</h1>
        <h5><u>Context and Problem</u></h5>
        <p>Our goal for this project was to find a startup that to design a website for them without looking at
            their actual website they created. In doing so, we were trying to best implement and display the 
            goals of the company. We were able to choose a company called Airhart Aeronautics.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Design Iterations</u></h5>
        <p>My design decisions focused on properly displaying what it is that the company was trying to do 
            in their business model. Thus, we tried to be as specific and clear as possible, giving the user
            a ton of information on how the could get involved and what exactly they would get when interacting
            with said company.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Research and Feedback</u></h5>
        <p>I found that this project was very futuristic, in that the startup that we were focusing on had a concept
            that had yet to be fully developed. Thus, it was a bit hard for us to properly implement everything they 
            were trying to display. However, we recieved good feedback on how to update our website mock-up so that 
            it made navigational sense to the user.
        </p>
        <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
        <p>This project allowed me to actively design a mock website only using a simple business model. We had not looked
            at the company website to design it beforehand, thus it was a very realistic design processâ€”we took an idea
            and built it into an interactive model.
